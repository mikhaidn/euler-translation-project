# Construction of isochronous curves in a resistant medium

It is known among geometers that an ordinary cycloid is equivalent to the tautochrone or isochrone curve in an environment of uniform gravity and no friction.
In the middle, too, for the simple reason of resisting velocities, the same cycloid is isochronous, says the great man, Newton in his Principles of Natural Philosophy, Lib. II Prop. 26. But I wonder at the town that no one has yet meditated anything about isochrons in other hypotheses of the mean resistance, not imaginary ones, as these two are said to be; since, however, this excellent matter is well deserved, which will be examined more deeply in the Science of the motion of bodies in the midst of resisting growth.
I, who have found in this matter, and which I have successfully discovered in the middle of the tautochronous curves resisting in any way, the center of forces infinitely expanding and uniformly attracting, I will share here with the public, in order to provide the literary world with a loop for a closer examination of this material.
